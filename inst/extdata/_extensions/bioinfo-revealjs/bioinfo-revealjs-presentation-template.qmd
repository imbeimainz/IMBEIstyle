## Possibly, the motivation

Yadda yadda

## The outline of your presentation?

1. first this
1. then that
1. aand then that again

# If you use a section for some slides...

(and you can actually navigate the slides also vertically in the ESC-view...)

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

Little bit of `content`

### A subheader

some content again

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

```{r}
#| echo: true
4 + 5
```


## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

Here is a link to the [IMBEI](https://unimedizin-mainz.de/IMBEI)

## The usual content

- Some bullet
- points
- and a break after that

. . .

the things after the break

## Something in two columns

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Left column

::: {.column width="50%"}
Right column

## Size of the content {.smaller}

Having smaller content only here

## Scrollable content {.scrollable}

Having a scrollable slide because you might have a looooong list of bullet points

## Some classic plots

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```

## Some classic plots - the same, but shown as fragment

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```


## A slide with tabsets

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Tab A

Content for `Tab A`

### Tab B

Content for `Tab B`

## This is ultra fancy {auto-animate="true"}

```r
# Fill in the spot we created for a plot
output$phonePlot <- renderPlot({
  # Render a barplot
})
```

## This is ultra fancy {auto-animate=true}

```r
# Fill in the spot we created for a plot
output$phonePlot <- renderPlot({
  # Render a barplot
  barplot(WorldPhones[,input$region]*1000, 
          main=input$region,
          ylab="Number of Telephones",
          xlab="Year")
})
```

## References?

Could be cool to have it automatically built
