# My first section {#sec-firstsectionlabel}

The content of that section

# My second section {#sec-secondsectionlabel}

The text for that, and a reference inside the document to @sec-firstsectionlabel

Something looking like `code`.

## A subsection

In there, it is easy to refer to Anka's work [@Ludt2022]

# TO DO

Some code chunks and referring to their outputs nicely

```{r}
#| label: fig-myplot
#| fig-cap: "Plot caption"

plot(cars)
```

For example, see @fig-myplot.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-iris
#| tbl-cap: "Iris Data"

library(knitr)
kable(head(iris))
```


# An unnumbered section {-}

For example an appendix?

I can refer here to the previous @tbl-iris
